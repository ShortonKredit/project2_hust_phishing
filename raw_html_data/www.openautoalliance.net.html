                  hail from around the world and reflect the global reach of Android, which has seen more than
                  one billion phones and tablets activated to date. The goal of the Alliance is to bring all of
                  the benefits users have grown to love about Android into their cars, creating a safer and more
                  convenient way to check the traffic, map out a route, or pick a playlist–but without
                  needing to use your hands. More simply, their goal is to create a connected car.
                </p><p>Today at the Google I/O developer conference, Google and OAA automakers showcased the first
                  integrations of Android Auto. Android Auto brings many of the apps drivers know and love, like
                  Google Maps and Spotify, to an interface that's built for driving. After connecting an Android
                  phone to a compatible car, drivers will be able to use Android apps and services specially
                  designed for use in a car and accessible through in-dash display and controls.
                </p><p>The expansion of the OAA shows its commitment to openness, customization and scale, which have
                  contributed to Android's success and are designed to help drive auto innovation. We welcome
                  more partners to join us on this journey, and drivers can expect to see the first cars with
                  Android Auto roll off the assembly line in 2014.

                  billion devices activated to date, a coalition of auto and technology companies announced today
                  a new industry alliance aimed at bringing the Android platform to a device that's always been

                <p>Audi, GM, Google, Honda, Hyundai and NVIDIA have joined together to form the Open Automotive

                  will drive innovation, and make technology in the car safer and more intuitive for everyone.
                </p>
                <p>The OAA is aimed at accelerating auto innovation with an approach that offers openness,
                  customization and scale, key tenets that have already made Android a familiar part of millions

                </p><p>“Millions of people are already familiar with Android and use it everyday,” said
                  Sundar Pichai, SVP of Android, Chrome &amp; Apps at Google. “The expansion of the Android
                  platform into automotive will allow our industry partners to more easily integrate mobile
                  technology into cars and offer drivers a familiar, seamless experience so they can focus on the
                  road.”
                </p><p>“We are very pleased to join this alliance with Google as a founding member because
                  Honda is committed to providing the very best connected-car experience to our customers,”
                  said Yoshiharu Yamamoto, president, CEO and director of Honda R&amp;D Co., Ltd. “The
                  Honda team is looking forward to collaborating with Google and all OAA members to help advance
                  the safety, value and ease of use of connected-car technologies.”
                </p><p>“Through the OAA, our customers using Android devices will soon be able to enjoy the
                  continuous user experience in their Hyundai and Kia vehicles.” said Dr. Woong-Chul Yang,
                  Vice Chairman of R&amp;D, Hyundai Motor Group. “By introducing the latest IT technologies
                  safely and securely throughout our full range of vehicles, we continually strive to provide the
                  highest levels of convenience and enhance the in-vehicle experience.”
                </p><p>“The car is the ultimate mobile computer. With onboard supercomputing chips, futuristic
                  cars of our dreams will no longer be science fiction,” said Jen-Hsun Huang, president and
                  chief executive officer, NVIDIA. “The OAA will enable the car industry to bring these
                  amazing cars to market faster.”
                </p><p>OAA members share a vision for the connected car, and bringing these open standards of
                  innovation to the market will help extend people's mobile experience seamlessly to another
                  platform they already know and love. Timing from each automaker will vary, but you can expect
                  to see the first cars with Android integration by the end of this year. The OAA invites other
                  automotive technology companies to join in this endeavor.

                  <div class="question">What is the Open Automotive Alliance™?</div>
                  <div class="answer" style="display: none;">The Open Automotive Alliance is a group of technology and automotive
                    companies who have come together to bring the best of Android into the automobile in a
                    seamless and driver-centric way that helps minimize distraction.

                  <div class="question">Why is this beneficial to automakers?</div>
                  <div class="answer" style="display: none;">Automakers will be able to leverage a platform already being used by
                    millions to deliver a familiar and consistent experience to their customers. Taking a
                    platform centric approach enables high quality application development in a way that is
                    purpose built for cars.

                  <div class="question">Why is this beneficial to drivers?</div>
                  <div class="answer" style="display: none;">Drivers are already trying to access mobile services while they're on the
                    road, but in ways that aren't always seamless or driver-centric. By working with automakers
                    to deliver these experiences in ways that make sense for the automobile, drivers can get what
                    they're looking for while keeping their primary focus on the road.

                  <div class="question">Why is this beneficial for developers?</div>
                  <div class="answer" style="display: none;">With the Android platform that developers are already familiar with to
                    target (rather than a patchwork of platforms from different automakers), developers will be
                    able to focus on delivering a powerful experience for users. Developers are able to take
                    advantage of template based frameworks which provide app customization for the developer
                    while also providing app familiarization for the driver to reduce distraction.

                    to bringing the best of mobile devices into the automobile in driver-centric and seamless
                    ways.

                  <div class="answer" style="display: none;">We're working with our partners to enable better integration between cars
                    and Android devices (e.g. phone pairing, voice-only text response) in order to create a
                    driver-centric, car optimized experience. We're also developing new Android platform features
                    that will enable the car itself to become a connected Android device. See more details and

                  <div class="answer" style="display: none;"><a href="https://www.android.com/auto/">Android Auto</a> integration and
                    functionality is already available for vehicles through a number of OAA's members and will be
                    expanding to more vehicles in the future.

                  <div class="question">Are you working with government safety organizations?</div>
                  <div class="answer" style="display: none;">Yes, we have been in contact with government agencies like the National
                    Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the U.S. Department of Transportation.
                    OAA's member companies also have experts who participate in technical automotive safety
                    committees including International Standards Organization (ISO) and Society of Automotive
                    Engineers (SAE). OAA's goal is to build an experience that helps drivers get what they're
                    looking for while keeping their primary focus on the road.

                  <div class="answer" style="display: none;">OAA members are working closely on technical research for reducing driver
                    distraction. As an example of these efforts, Google has an internal driver distraction lab
                    which is staffed with safety research experts to continuously evaluate concepts and features
                    and are engaged in the automotive research community through a variety of efforts including
                    funding academic research labs, participating in technical research and safety committees,
                    and participating in industry research consortiums for furthering the understanding and
                    evaluation of distraction.
