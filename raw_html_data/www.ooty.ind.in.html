       <p align="justify">Ooty City is one of the important and Interesting Tourist spots  of Tamil Nadu. &nbsp;This place has very cool  and chill climate in summer season so it is one of the best known hill resorts of  India. &nbsp;The other name of Ooty is Udhagamandalam or Ootacamund.&nbsp; It is also called as the  “Queen of Hills Stations”. &nbsp;Ootacamund is the summer capital of Madras presidency.</p>
       <p>Ooty town covers an area of about 36 square  kilometers. It is located at the tri-junction of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and  Karnataka. The city of Udagamandalam is at an altitude of 7350 feet or (2,240 m) above  sea level. It has extraordinary natural beauty in the middle of the Nilgiris.  The Nilgiris are also known as the Blue Mountains because of the misty blue  clouds that accompany its peaceful ranges. Udhagai is part of the Southwest  Ghats Rainforest Eco zone. The highest peak in the Nilgiris is Thottapetta  (2,623 m). About 10 km from the lake.       </p><div class="google-auto-placed ap_container" style="width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;"><ins data-ad-format="auto" class="adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate" data-ad-client="ca-pub-9291737033108347" data-adsbygoogle-status="done" style="display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;"><div id="aswift_3_host" style="border: none; height: 280px; width: 570px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; background-color: transparent; display: inline-block;"></div></ins></div>
       <p align="justify">Nilgiris is  one of the smallest districts of Tamil Nadu. It is about 1616 sq km area. It is  a bridge of hills between the ruggedly beautiful Eastern Ghats, famous for  their granite and densely forested Western Ghats.       </p>
       <p align="justify">Forests and  grasslands combine to form the district. The Nilgiris on the Wayanad (Kerala)  side are densely forested and at a lower altitude (average 1,200 m) than Tamil  Nadu, where the famous 'hill stations' of Ooty, Coonoor and Kotagiri are situate,  amid the lush green meadows of the plateau.</p>
       <p>This place have British Buildings and British  Names St. Stephen's Church Governor Stephen's Church is named after Governor  Stephen Rumbold Lushington, as is Lushington School. Lawrence School and Breeks  Memorial School are also named after another age of British. Lady Canning's  Seat, Lamb's Rock, Dolphin's Nose, Club Hill and Elk Hill are unmistakably  British-sounding and the scenery viewed from these places is decidedly English;  Tall pines, conifers and eucalyptus stand proudly next to emerald-green lakes  and red-tiled cottages and lush lawns and rose gardens.</p><div class="google-auto-placed ap_container" style="width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;"><ins data-ad-format="auto" class="adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate" data-ad-client="ca-pub-9291737033108347" data-adsbygoogle-status="done" style="display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;"><div id="aswift_4_host" style="border: none; height: 280px; width: 570px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; background-color: transparent; display: inline-block;"></div></ins></div>
       <p>Peach  and plum orchards, and the terraced tea gardens for which Udagamandalam is famous, are a  legacy of the British, who first introduced these crops here. So are English  faces; Many of these Britons fell in love with this little England they  discovered in India and settled down here. It is, without a doubt, yet best 'hill  station' and a must-see tourist destination for anyone visiting India. </p>
       <p align="justify">Ootacamund City 36 Sq. km in area and at an altitude  of 2,240m. Vast plantations of eucalyptus, pine and wattle stretch between some  of the untouched grasslands that remain of the pre-British Ootacamund. Forestry  in independent India continued the ecological transformation the British had  begun in Ootacamund, introducing exotic conifers into the gentle, undulating  lowlands to meet the growing needs of the forest-based industries. However,  even though it no longer means nature, Ootacamund is still beautiful and a  paradise for nature lovers, trekkers and sports enthusiasts.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>Ooty  Hill Station of Tamil Nadu South India</strong></h2>
      <p align="justify">Udagamandalam Hill Station is situated in Nilgris District Tamil Nadu India. It is a beautiful mountain range which is a part of  Western Ghats. Totally there are three places to visit namely Kothagiri, Coonoor and Udhaga mandalam. Among these three Ooti has given the primal importance because  of its scenic beauty and excellent climate conditions. Nilgri Hills are older  than the Great Himalayas. Like Icing on a cake Ootagamund adds Pride to this mountain  range.  It  is about 556km from Chennai.</p>
       <p align="justify">  Ooti Hill Station was first discovered in 1819 by John Sullivan. He was  the Collector of Coimbatore and it was later named as Ootacamund    derived from the word Ottakkalmandu, which means the ‘village of a single stone’. The Madras Gazette  received the letter Wotokymund in the year of 1821 March. It was first  reference got from name. Udaga mandalam is the Tamil name proposed by the government.&nbsp; The entire region was previously inhabited by  the Toda tribal’s.       </p><div class="google-auto-placed ap_container" style="width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;"><ins data-ad-format="auto" class="adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate" data-ad-client="ca-pub-9291737033108347" data-adsbygoogle-status="done" style="display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;"><div id="aswift_5_host" style="border: none; height: 280px; width: 570px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; background-color: transparent; display: inline-block;"></div></ins></div>
       <p align="justify">Hoysala king Vishnuvardhana’s record has references of Toda  of Nilgiris and king’s general Punisa dated 1117CE. &nbsp;Toda people are well known for farming  activities and raising of water buffalo.       </p>
       <p align="justify">The  Nilgiris of the south are a classed by themselves.&nbsp; They contain excellent summer resorts such as  Coonoor and Kotagiri. The chain of mountains lies between Mysore in the north  and Coimbatore in the south.&nbsp; The highest  point is at an altitude of 2619m.&nbsp; It nestles on the Nilgiri  range at an altitude of 2286m. The extraordinary scenic beauty of this place  matched by the salubrious climate makes it a most favoured hill sation in the  south.&nbsp; The Rolling Meadows, lush gardens  and placid lakes are all reminiscent of the British. It still retains something  Indian in its cottages and stone arches, and offers many profiles of nature,  each imbued with a distinctive grandeur. The original inhabitants of Udgamandalam were  Todas, a colorful pastoral tribe. Other forest tribes found around the Nilgiris  are Kotas, Kurubas, Irulas and Panias. Perhaps no other hill station has so  much to offer as Ootacamund. There are quite a number of interesting places to  see in  Tamilnadu.</p>
      <h2 align="center"><strong>Nilgiri  Mountain Railway Or Ooty Mountain Train or Toy Train</strong></h2>
       <p align="justify"> Toy  train  is a beautiful journey in the Nilgiri Mountain. It  gives us a memorable experience. The  fresh clean air and the breath taking views are not be forgotten easily. The  maximum speed of the train is 33km per hour.&nbsp;  The climb  to Udgamandalam from the plain used to be a treacherous journey on a ghat road in  bullock carts, ponies and palanquins aided by the Nilgiri carrying company's  Mail and Express Tonga Service.&nbsp; British  engineers proposed a mountain railway as early as 1854 but it was not until  1891 that Lord Wenlock, the Governor of Madras, laid the foundation of the  Nilgiri Mountain Railway.&nbsp; in 1899, the  first train chugged up the slopes from Mettupalayam (36m/1,069ft) to Coonor  (1,712/5,617ft), before the rail link was extended to Ooti (2,203m/7,228ft) in  1903. </p>
       <p>The Mountain Railway at Darjeeling and Shimla is not so  older than the Udhagamandalam, the 46km train journey is the steepest in Asia, with a maximum  gradient of 1:12 (8.33 percent).&nbsp;</p><div class="google-auto-placed ap_container" style="width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;"><ins data-ad-format="auto" class="adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate" data-ad-client="ca-pub-9291737033108347" data-adsbygoogle-status="done" style="display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;"><div id="aswift_6_host" style="border: none; height: 280px; width: 570px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; background-color: transparent; display: inline-block;"></div></ins></div>
       <p> The journey starts at Mettupalaam and covers  the 46km in 4hours. The  train passes through 16 tunnels, forest-clad hills and lush green tea-plantations  and rumbles across tall girder bridges. </p>
       <p> The railway link was not just  an engineering marvel; it also revolutionized the Nilgiri tea industry with  swift transportation from the estates to the plains and back to Britain.&nbsp; Using a rack and pinion Alternate Biting  Teeth (ABT) system, it takes nearly 5hr for the ascent with the engine pushing  the train from behind.&nbsp; The scenic  terrain past hills, valleys, forests and plantations changes with every mile as  the train negotiates 16 tunnels, 27 viaducts and 208 curves.&nbsp; From Mettupalaiyam station, the train climbs  7km past betelnut, palm and coconut plantations to Kallar, an elevation of 405m/1,329ft.  The train crosses Kallar Bridge over the Bhavani River, Adderley Viaduct,  Burliar Bridge and 14 tunnels as it crosses tropical jungles via Hill Grove to  Conoor (Adderley, Runnymede and Kateri are no longer stops). </p>
       <p align="justify"> Nilgiri Mountain Railway was depicted in David Lean's 1984 film A Passage  to India.&nbsp; Coonoor railway station, a  beautiful Colonial structure built in 1897, was one of the scenic locales.&nbsp; A steam locomotive, x37390, constructed by  Swiss Locomotive Works in 1922 and retired after chugging 7.5km, stands  outside! From Conor, the train climbs via Wellington, Aruvankadu, Ketti,  Lovedale and Fernhill (the highest point).&nbsp; The train leaves daily from Mettupalayam at  7.10 am  returns at 3pm, completing the downhill journey in  3.5hr.&nbsp; There are also four daily trains  each way between Udgamandalam and Coonoor.&nbsp; In  2005, UNESCO added the Nilgiri Mountain Railway to its list of World Heritage  Sites.&nbsp; Despite having computerized ticketing  systems, the NMR still issues manually stamped Edmondson railway tickets,  retaining its old-world charm. </p>
      <h2 align="center"><strong>About Ooty City in Tamil Nadu India</strong></h2>
       <p>It is one  of the oldest mountain ranges.&nbsp; It is  older than the Himalayas. It is  about 89km via Mettupalayam (54km southeast) and Coonoor (19km).&nbsp; Sent to investigate the 'fabulous tales'  surrounding the Blue Mountains or 'Neilgherries', John Sullivan, the Collector  of Coimbatore set up a bungalow at Kotagiri in 1819 and came to this place in 1822.&nbsp; After his departure, the commandant of Utti  moved into Sullivan's house in 1846, which was later occupied by three European  schools (including Lawrence, which sifted to Lovedale).&nbsp; European  soon started settling down here. They  use the valley for summer stays. The  complete valley has become a summer resort. The  practice of moving the government to hills during summer months also started.</p>
<p>The large patch of green set up to grow 'English  vegetables at reasonable cost' was converted into a Botanical Garden in  1848.&nbsp; The Stone House served as the  Summer Secretariat of the Governor of Madras Presidency till 1937 and Udhagamandalam eventually became what Sullivan had envisioned it to be the Queen of Hill  Stations, Scotland of the East.&nbsp; The  'sweet half-English air of Neilgherry' drew poet Lord Alfred Tennyson while  Lord Lytoon, Viceroy of India, raved about Ootahamund's Hertfordshire lanes, Devonshire  down, Westmoreland lakes, Scotch trout streams and Lusitanian views'.</p>

<p align="justify"> This  Nilgiris was originally tribal land and it was occupied by the Todas around is  now the Udhaga mandalam area and by Kotas around what is now the Kotagiri area. The Badagas  appeared here much later from the Mysore plateau. </p>
      <p align="justify">Udhagai is located in  an amphitheatre of hills stretching over 3km in a northwesterly direction, one  of the hill station's most famous sights, the airtifical  Lake, it can be  found to the south-west of town.&nbsp; The  Boat House is the hub of all activities with boating horse rides, gardens,  eateries and touristy amusement parks.&nbsp;  Motorboats are available for 20min  and pedal boats  for 30min.&nbsp;  Besides horse riding,  ornamental plants and seeds are also available near the lake exit.&nbsp; Thread Garden is a bizarre collection of 15  species of plants recreated out of thread. On the road back towards town, the  TTDC run Jolly World Lake Park has slides and go-karting and is popular with  families.</p>
       <h2 align="center">  Sightseeing Places</h2>
       <p>Sightseeing places are India’s largest Rose Garden Lies in the Elk Hill of northwestern  slope.&nbsp; We can see Ferns hills on the  south. An attractive lake is on the east side of the hill. This Garden was  started in 1955 to commemorate the Centenary flower festival. &nbsp;This Rose Garden’s area is about 4ha/10acres  in 5 terraces.&nbsp; It has 2,241 Rose varieties  (best enjoyed in early summer).&nbsp; This  Garden is awarded as Best Rose Garden in South Asia in 2006. It won the Garden  of Excellence Award at Osaka. &nbsp;       </p>
       <p align="justify"> Etiennes  Road, skirts north of the garden, joins Charing Cross, Ootacamund's main junction.  Due east and spreading around Sulivan's original Stone House is the Government  Arts College.&nbsp; Just across the bust SH-15  is Lawley Institute, a club formed in 1911 for upper-class Indians in response  to the snobbish attitude of the Utti and Gymkhana clubs.&nbsp; Ironically, Sri Arthur Lawley, Governor of  Madras laid the foundation stone.</p><div class="google-auto-placed ap_container" style="width: 100%; height: auto; clear: both; text-align: center;"><ins data-ad-format="auto" class="adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate" data-ad-client="ca-pub-9291737033108347" data-adsbygoogle-status="done" style="display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent; height: 280px;"><div id="aswift_7_host" style="border: none; height: 280px; width: 570px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; visibility: visible; background-color: transparent; display: inline-block;"></div></ins></div>
      <p align="justify"> North of  it, opposite the Tibetan Market off Woodhouse Road, is another famous sight of  this hill station, the Botanical Garden Occupying a deep ravine below Raj Bhavan, the summer  residence of the Governor.&nbsp; Designed in  1848 with the help of W.G. Mclvor from the Kew Royal Botanical Garden in  England, the 26ha/65-acre garden has various nurseries, terraces and  conservatories.&nbsp; Its chief attractions  are a 20 million-year-old fossil tree trunk, the unusual dragon tree, a Toda  mund (tribal village), an Italian garden laid by Italian POWs and the kikuyu  grass imported from East Africa, on which many a film song has been picturised.

It is  genetically more similar to members of the genus ovis than to other Tahrs.&nbsp; The Nilgiri  Tahrs are stocky goats with short, coarse fur and a bristly mane. Males  are larger than the females and have a dark color when mature. Both  sexes have curved horns, which are larger in the males reaching up to 40 cm for  males and 30cm for females.&nbsp; &nbsp;Adult males weigh 80-100kg and stand about  100cm tall at the shoulder. The  tahrs inhabit the open montane grassland habitat of the south Western Ghats  montane rain forests eco region. &nbsp;At elevations from 1200 to 2600m the forests  open into grasslands interspersed with pockets of stunted forests known as  sholas. These  grassland habitats are surrounded by dense forests at the lower elevations. The  Nilgiri Tahrs formerly ranged over these grasslands in large herds Hunting and  poaching in the nineteenth century reduced their population to as few as 100  animals by the early 20th century.&nbsp;  Since  that time their populations have increased somewhat and presently number about  2000 individuals.

       <h3>Where is  Udagamandalam? </h3>
      <p align="justify">Udagamandalam is in Nilgiris  District, Tamil Nadu, India.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <h3 align="center"> History</h3>
      <p align="justify">The Nilgiri Hills were never under dynastic rule.  Behind the blue curtain that surrounds the Nilgiris and gives them the name  Blue Mountains, they live in peaceful seclusion, while, at their feet, wars are  fought between great dynasties. </p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;However, history records that the Gangars  (mid-10th century), Hoysalas (11th century AD), Mysore kings (1610 – 1792 AD)  and the ruling families of Kottayam laid claim to the region during their time.  In fact, when the British took over this place, they settled the claim of the ruler  of Kottayam by giving him a handsome pension. John Sullivan, who was the  Collector of Coimbatore, visited the place in 1819, after which he started  developing it. In 1823 a route known as the 'bridle path’ was laid which was  the best route from the Coimbatore side to the hill country until the first Coonoor  Ghat was laid in 1830-1832. Mr Sullivan built the Stone House in 1822, which  was to be his home for many years to come. Between  1821 and 1824 many new tracks were laid. He closed the valley near Bishoptown  to conduct agricultural and horticultural experiments. In 1826, further impetus  was given to the government's plan to use Udagamandalam as a sanatorium and roads were  built around the settlement. The settlement soon expanded. Shops were opened  by some Bombay Parsis, the Church Missionary Society started a school for  Europeans (1832) and William Rumbold began building his house, which later  became a hotel (1831). The  foothills of Coonoor led to the settlement of Coonoor. Much development took  place in the Nilgiris in 1837 during Stephen Rumbold Lushington's governorship,  when coffee estates were established here for the first time. </p>
      <p>In 1860, the plateau west of Baikara, the  Kunthas and the low country north of the plateau west of Baikara, the Kunthas  and the low country north of the plateau were annexed to the Coimbatore  district.</p>
      <p>In 1868, the Nilgiris were separated from  Coimbatore and placed under a Commissioner and Assistant who combined revenue,  criminal and civil jurisdiction. Further  annexations in 1873 and 1877 resulted in the annexation of the Ochterloni  Valley and south-eastern Wayanad district. Large  areas are cultivated with tea, coffee and cinchona and the district is now the  official summer resort of the government. Due to this, it was put on par with other  districts and became a Collectorate in 1882.</p>
      <p align="justify">British officials and citizens in general  longed for their own country and English climate, so when Udhagamandalam was discovered,  it became a dream come true for the British who longed for something like  'home' in India. Many new buildings came, and the influx of immigrants did not  stop. Indian maharajas followed the English aristocracy and palaces vied for a  place with British cottages.</p>
      <p align="justify"> Lavish parties became the order of the day; soon  social life is a whirlwind of fun and frolic; And Ooty became the queen of hill  stations.</p>
