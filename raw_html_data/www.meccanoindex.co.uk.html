	<h3 class="marA3">Meccano Parts Directory (MPD)</h3>
	<p class="mar36"><span class="red">(Last updated 7<sup>th</sup> February)</span></p>
 	<p class="mar66">I am pleased to include the Meccano Parts Directory (MPD) on my Meccano Information website. MPD is the successor to the Online Parts Museum (OPM) that is on the NZ Meccano website. MPD aims to continue where the OPM left off. I.e. from part 143 onwards (so far  parts 143, 168-168d, 154-154b, 188-192, 199, 200 and 221 - 226 have been added). However for everyone's convenience I have provided embedded links to all the OPM information on the NZ website, so that all the part information can be found here in one place.</p>
 	<p class="mar66">The Meccano Parts Directory aims to catalogue the many parts produced by Meccano Ltd and its affiliated companies over the years.</p>
 	<p class="mar66">There is also a forum on this MPD website, to allow people to contribute information on parts. There is a separate sub-forum for each part (or group of parts) covered on this MPD website together with other parts not yet covered. This allows information to be provided in advance of a part being dealt with.</p>

 	<h3 class="marA3">Brian Rowe's Model Building Instructions</h3>
	<p class="mar36"><span class="red">(Last updated 28<sup>th</sup> November 2024)</span></p>
	
	<p class="mar66">In this section of my website I have some of Brian Rowe's Model Building Instructions that you can download. His Treatise has now been added.</p>
	<p class="mar66">From the 1970s to the 1990s Brian Rowe designed and built a large number of Meccano models. These were mainly models of steam engine of various types. For many of these he produced building instructions. He would sell the instructions and associated photos by mail order and at exhibitions. Following Brian's death in the late 1990s, these building instructions have virtually all disappeared from the Meccano scene and I felt that it would be good to resurrect them.</p>
	<p class="mar6A">If anyone else has any more of Brian Rowe's Model Building Instructions or model photos that are not on this website, please get in contact with me.</p>

 	<h3 class="marA3">User Galleries</h3>
	<p class="mar36"><span class="red">(New 6<sup>th</sup> November 2024)</span></p>
	
	<p class="mar66">This new section provides a place for Meccano enthusiasts to upload their own photos and document files (Word, Excel and PDF at present) for display in user galleries. One can have as many 'User Galleries' as you wish. There is also no limit to the number of photos/files in a User Gallery. Note that docx Word and pdf files can be read online without having to download them first.</p> 
	<p class="mar66">Search facilities are provided against the file's title and description. You can also bring up recently uploaded photos/files or changed User Galleries.</p>
	<p class="mar66">Note that before one can upload photos/files you first need to register with the site. Note that due to spam considerations, the authorisation of new users is done manually. Therefore after you have registered, please send me an email so that I can approve your registration promptly.</p>
	<p class="mar66">Please let me know if you have any problems or have suggestions for improvements.</p>
	<p class="mar66">Note that in my User Gallery there are scans of most Meccano stickers, decals and cardboard parts available for download.</p>
